### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why ECMAScript and not [my-favorite-language]?

That's a good question! Initially, the proof of concept was written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by [Yugo](https://github.com/x47188) & [joaodforce](https://github.com/joaodforce), while Rust is an incredible c-speed and memory-safe language it was not a highly accessible one. To maximize the chance of getting contributions from the community, one of the many existing projects was promoted and ECMAScript was chosen.

#### Can I skip the annoying pre-commit hook?

We use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run a hook at commit.
If you want to skip it add a `--no-verify` to your `git commit`.
